# eShopOnAbp

This is a reference project for those who want to build microservice solutions with the ABP Framework.

See [the blog post](https://blog.abp.io/abp/Introducing-the-eShopOnAbp-Project) for more info.

## Issues

Please open issues on the main GitHub repository: https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues

## How to Run?

You can run it in Visual Studio or use [Microsoft Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye). Tye is a developer tool that makes developing, testing, and deploying micro-services and distributed applications easier.

 ### Requirements

- .NET 7.0+
- Docker
- Yarn

### Instructions

- Clone the repository ( [eShopOnAbp](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp) )

- Install Tye (*follow [these steps](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md#installing-tye)*)

- Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` file and provide PayPal ClientID and Secret.

- Execute `run-tye.ps1`

- Wait until all applications are up!

	- You can check the running application from `tye` dashboard ([localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/))
	- **Note**: If you see all of your applications keep restarting on `tye` dashboard or `tye` console, you may be facing SSL certificate issues. To diagnose the problems better, check any application logs. If it is related to SSL, developer certificate creation may have failed because of Powershell issues regarding authorization. Check the PowerShell script running configuration and set the policy for your local machine as follows: 
	```bash
	Get-ExecutionPolicy -list
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
	```
	See [Microsoft Powershell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.2) for more information.

- After all your backend services are up, start the angular application:

  ```bash
  cd apps/angular
  yarn start
  ```

### Certificate Expiration
If the certificate is expired, you'll see the following error:

<!-- Make it smaller with 320px height  -->
<img src="docs/images/ssl-error.png" height="320"/>

Generating a new certificate will fix that issue. To generate a new one,

- Remove `etc/dev-cert/localhost.pfx`

- Manually execute `create-certificate.ps1` **or** re-run solution with `run-tye.ps1`
